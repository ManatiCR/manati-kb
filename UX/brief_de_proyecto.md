###Conceptual Proposal [CLIENT]
####Site Goal:
Renew and position [CLIENT]'s new image with a compelling informative, easy to use website that represent the organization as a relevant regional mechanism in addressing issues related to Animal & Plant Health, Genetic Resources & Tree Fruits.

####Core Problem
We understand that the core problem of [CLIENT] is the lack of content produced right now in the site. This leads to lack of content to share in social media or any other social outlets, thus limiting the amount of reach [CLIENT] can have.

The content created for the website is written exclusively by the Task Forces, which have limited time to write content and share it. Also, the content they want to create and share is not easily made, since it represent scientific breakthrough and discovery which they cannot write before having a paper or a more official document published.

####Solution
Understanding the goal of [CLIENT]'s website and the limitations regarding the creation of content, Manatí's solution is to create a website that allows Task Force members to publish different types of content:

* Abstracts of relevant papers
* Reports, minutes, discussions.
* Presentations shared in symposiums related to their thematic areas
* Magazine updated quarterly from a different thematic area each time
* Events regarding their thematic area
* Downloadable databases
* Possible: browsable genetic database

####Benefits
This approach will help Task Force members to share more content regularly thus helping position [CLIENT] as a relevant regional mechanism.

Creating this new ways to share content will facilitate Task Force members to publish more content. By using Drupal interface, they will also find easier to publish than the actual website, which will translate in spending less on technical support.

####Limitations
Technology doesn't create a great website, it does help to achieve better results, but to have a better website and to settle as a relevant regional mechanism in addressing issues related to Animal & Plant Health, Genetic Resources & Tree Fruits, the more important and crucial aspect for the website to succeed is the content being created. 

We think the Task Force can really help to create content for the website, but they are not the only one that could update the website with relevant information regarding each thematic area.
